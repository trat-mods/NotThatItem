# Not That Item please!

NotThatItem introduces a filter item that allows the player to prevent picking up a specific item.  
To select the item, **the filter item must be placed in the main hand and used**: a dedicated UI will open.   
In this UI it is possible to select an item to exclude by simply taking one of it and clicking on the presented slot.
From that point on, whenever the filter is in the main hand or on the off hand, the item will not be picked up by the player.    
> This can be very useful, especially when digging massive holes with a maxed out beacon ðŸ‘Œ

The crafting recipe is the following:
